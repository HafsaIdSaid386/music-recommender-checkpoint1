Reduced it to the first 10,000 songs

Cleaned the data

Performed basic EDA (histograms + heatmap)

Scaled numeric features

Computed cosine similarity

Built a simple recommend() function

Baseline Model

The baseline model uses content-based filtering with cosine similarity to recommend similar songs based on audio features.

Next Steps

Add mood-based commands

Build the interactive chat UI

Improve recommendations
